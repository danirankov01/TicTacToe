# TicTacToe
My first basic tic-tac-toe game v.1

I guess it would be boring in the age of technology to play this game from the era of your forefathers but it's for one of those days... where I want you to imagine that you don't have electricity because somebody is doing current prevention, you don't have the internet and you have to take care of your little brother or sister. However there is a bright side your computer has 100% battery so you will be able to play with your family for a long time until the electricity comes back on.
